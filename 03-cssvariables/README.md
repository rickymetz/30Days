[Demo Link](https://rickymetz.github.io/30Days/02-clock/index.html)

## Questions

- Not so much related to JS but I'm not sure why there's a 2px gap at the bottom of the image wrapper.
- Would be neat to save values to local storage, allow user to upload and download an image.

## Enhancements

- Added img opacity slider.
- Added blend mode dropdown.
